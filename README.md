## üéØ Key Patterns Covered

### .NET Design Patterns

**GoF (Gang of Four) Patterns:**
1. **Creational Patterns**: Singleton, Factory Method, Abstract Factory, Builder, Prototype
2. **Structural Patterns**: Adapter, Bridge, Composite, Decorator, Facade, Flyweight, Proxy
3. **Behavioral Patterns**: Chain of Responsibility, Command, Iterator, Mediator, Memento, Observer, State, Strategy, Template Method, Visitor

**Modern & Enterprise Patterns:**
- Repository Pattern, Unit of Work
- Dependency Injection
- CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)
- MediatR Pattern
- Clean Architecture
- Microservices Patterns

### Angular Design Patterns

**1. Component Patterns**
- **Smart/Dumb Components**: Separates components into smart containers (with logic) and dumb presentational components (pure UI)
- **Component Composition**: Builds complex UIs by composing smaller, reusable components
- **Component Communication**: Various ways components communicate via `@Input/@Output`, services, and ViewChild

**2. Service Patterns**
- **Singleton Services**: Application-wide state and functionality
- **Facade Services**: Simplified interface to complex subsystems
- **Factory Services**: Creates instances based on configuration

**3. State Management**
- **Reactive Data Flow**: Using RxJS streams for managing data flow
- **NgRx**: Centralized state management for complex applications
- **Local Component State**: State management within components
- **Shared State with Services**: State sharing between components

**4. Performance Optimizations**
- **OnPush Change Detection**: Optimizes performance with immutable data
- **Virtual Scrolling**: Efficient rendering of large lists
- **Lazy Loading**: Loading feature modules on demand

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. Clone this repository or download the files
2. Choose your guide based on your technology stack:
   - **.NET Developers**: Read through `.net_design_patterns.md`
   - **Angular Developers**: Read through `angular_design_patterns.md`
3. Explore the comprehensive code examples and patterns
4. Implement these patterns in your projects
5. Use the decision trees and matrices to choose the right pattern for your scenario

## üí° Best Practices

### For .NET Developers

1. **Start with GoF Patterns**: Master the 23 classic design patterns first
2. **Modern Architecture**: Apply Clean Architecture, Onion Architecture principles
3. **Dependency Injection**: Use DI containers (built-in .NET DI, Autofac)
4. **CQRS**: Implement Command Query Responsibility Segregation for complex systems
5. **Repository & Unit of Work**: Use these patterns for data access abstraction
6. **Testing**: Write unit tests with proper mocking and stubbing
7. **Async/Await**: Properly implement asynchronous patterns for performance

### For Angular Developers

1. **Architecture Planning**: Use feature modules, implement lazy loading, plan component hierarchy
2. **Component Design**: Use OnPush change detection, implement trackBy functions, separate concerns
3. **Service Layer**: Use singleton services, implement HTTP interceptors, use reactive programming
4. **State Management**: Choose appropriate state management, use immutable data patterns
5. **Performance**: Use virtual scrolling, implement proper change detection strategies
6. **Testing**: Write unit tests for components and services, implement integration tests

## üí¨ Remember

### For .NET Developers
The biggest mistake developers make is not understanding when to use each pattern. Don't just apply patterns blindly - understand the problem first, then choose the appropriate solution.

### For Angular Developers
The biggest mistake developers make is not leveraging Angular's built-in patterns and trying to reinvent the wheel. Angular provides excellent patterns out of the box - use them!

Good luck with your development! üöÄ
